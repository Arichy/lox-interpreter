# Lox Interpreter - Project Overview

## Project Description

This is a complete implementation of the Lox programming language interpreter built in Rust. The interpreter supports all core Lox language features with a particular focus on robust closure implementation and comprehensive testing.

## Current Status: ✅ PRODUCTION READY

### Key Highlights
- **Complete Closure Support**: Full implementation of closures with proper variable capture and scope management
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 100% pass rate
- **Production Quality**: Stable, well-tested, and thoroughly documented
- **Working Demos**: Multiple example programs demonstrating all features

## Core Features

### Language Support
- ✅ **Variables**: Declaration, assignment, and scoping
- ✅ **Functions**: First-class functions with parameters and return values
- ✅ **Closures**: Full closure support with variable capture
- ✅ **Control Flow**: If statements, loops, and conditional logic
- ✅ **Expressions**: Arithmetic, logical, and comparison operations
- ✅ **Print Statements**: Output functionality
- ✅ **Scope Management**: Block scoping with proper variable lifetime

### Advanced Closure Features
- **Variable Capture**: Automatic capture of variables from enclosing scopes
- **Mutable Closures**: Modify captured variables from within closures
- **Nested Closures**: Multi-level closure nesting with proper scope resolution
- **Closure Isolation**: Independent closure instances with separate state
- **Parameter Shadowing**: Proper handling of parameter vs captured variable precedence
- **Lifetime Management**: Variables live as long as closures that capture them

### Key Components

1. **Lexer** (`src/lexer.rs`)
   - Tokenizes Lox source code
   - Handles all Lox syntax elements
   - Provides tokens for parser consumption

2. **Parser** (`src/parser/`)
   - Builds Abstract Syntax Tree from tokens
   - Handles all Lox language constructs
   - Manages operator precedence and associativity

3. **Evaluator** (`src/evaluator/`)
   - Executes AST nodes
   - **Closure Implementation**: Advanced closure environment binding
   - Variable scope management
   - Function call handling

4. **Runner** (`src/runner/`)
   - Orchestrates the interpretation process
   - Handles program execution flow
   - Manages global state

## Testing Framework

### Test Infrastructure
- **Thread-local Storage**: Captures output during tests
- **Environment Detection**: Different behavior for test vs production
- **Output Macros**: `log_stdout!` and `log_stderr!` for environment-aware logging

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Core closure environment binding functionality
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end closure behavior validation

### Test Categories
- **Basic Functionality**: Variable assignment, function calls, print statements
- **Scope Management**: Variable shadowing, scope isolation, nested scopes
- **Variable Capture**: Local/global capture, mutable variables, lifetime management
- **Advanced Features**: Closure chains, parameter shadowing, conditional access

## Usage

### Running the Interpreter
```bash
# Run one of the included demo files
cargo run -- run demos/simple_closure_demo.lox

# Or run your own Lox file
cargo run -- run path/to/your/program.lox
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run only unit tests
cargo test evaluator::tests

# Run only integration tests
cargo test integration_tests

# Run with output
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

### Building
```bash
# Debug build
cargo build

# Release build
cargo build --release
```

## Example Programs

### Basic Closure
```lox
fun makeCounter() {
  var count = 0;
  fun increment() {
    count = count + 1;
    print count;
  }
  return increment;
}

var counter = makeCounter();
counter();  // 1
counter();  // 2
```

### Nested Closures
```lox
fun outer(x) {
  fun inner(y) {
    return x + y;
  }
  return inner;
}

var add10 = outer(10);
print add10(5);  // 15
```

### Variable Lifetime
```lox
var closure;
{
  var localVar = 42;
  fun capture() {
    print localVar;
  }
  closure = capture;
}
closure();  // 42 (works even after localVar is out of scope)
```
