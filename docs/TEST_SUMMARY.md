# Test Summary - Lox Interpreter Closure Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive test suite for the Lox interpreter's closure implementation. The test suite includes both unit tests and integration tests to ensure robust closure behavior.

## Test Architecture

### Output Capture System
- **Test Environment Detection**: Tests use conditional compilation to detect test environment
- **Thread-Local Storage**: Uses `thread_local!` storage for capturing stdout/stderr during tests
- **Macros**: `log_stdout!` and `log_stderr!` macros route output appropriately:
  - In test environment: Captured to thread-local storage
  - In production: Normal stdout/stderr output

### Test Structure
- **Unit Tests**: Located in `evaluator::tests` module
- **Integration Tests**: Located in `integration_tests` module

## Unit Tests

Located in `src/evaluator/tests.rs`, these tests verify the low-level closure variable capture mechanism (`collect_closure_bindings`):

1. **`test_capture_single_variable`** - Verifies that a single upvalue is correctly captured.
2. **`test_capture_multiple_variables`** - Ensures multiple distinct upvalues are captured.
3. **`test_no_capture_for_local_variables`** - Confirms that variables local to the function are not captured.
4. **`test_no_capture_for_parameters`** - Ensures that function parameters are not treated as upvalues.
5. **`test_capture_with_shadowing`** - Checks that the correct variable is captured when a local variable shadows an upvalue.

## Integration Tests

Located in `src/integration_tests.rs`, these tests verify end-to-end closure functionality:

### Basic Closure Functionality
- **`test_simple_print`** - Basic interpreter functionality
- **`test_variable_assignment`** - Variable assignment and access
- **`test_closure_counter`** - Basic closure with mutable state
- **`test_closure_with_parameters`** - Closures with parameters

### Scope and Variable Handling
- **`test_closure_scope_shadowing`** - Variable shadowing in closure scopes
- **`test_closure_scope_isolation`** - Isolation between different closure instances
- **`test_closure_complex_scoping`** - Complex scoping scenarios
- **`test_nested_closure_scope`** - Nested closure scope behavior

### Advanced Closure Features
- **`test_multiple_closures_same_env`** - Multiple closures sharing environment
- **`test_simple_nested_closure`** - Simple nested closure functionality
- **`test_closure_with_global_vars`** - Closures interacting with global variables
- **`test_closure_with_local_function`** - Closures with local function definitions
- **`test_closure_variable_mutation`** - Mutable variable capture and modification
- **`test_closure_parameter_shadowing`** - Parameter shadowing in closures

### Edge Cases and Lifetime Management
- **`test_closure_captures_after_reassignment`** - Variable capture after reassignment
- **`test_closure_variable_lifetime`** - Variable lifetime in closures
- **`test_multiple_closures_same_variable`** - Multiple closures sharing same variable
- **`test_closure_captures_from_multiple_scopes`** - Capturing from multiple scope levels
- **`test_closure_with_conditional_capture`** - Conditional variable access in closures
- **`test_closure_modifies_captured_after_scope_ends`** - Modifying captured variables after scope ends
- **`test_closure_chain_variable_access`** - Variable access through closure chains
- **`test_closure_parameter_vs_captured_variable`** - Parameter vs captured variable precedence

## Test Results

All tests pass successfully, demonstrating:
- ✅ Correct closure environment binding
- ✅ Proper variable capture and scope management
- ✅ Mutable variable handling in closures
- ✅ Complex nested closure scenarios
- ✅ Edge cases and lifetime management
- ✅ Parameter vs captured variable precedence

## Test Design Principles

1. **Isolation**: Each test is independent and can run in any order
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests cover basic functionality, edge cases, and complex scenarios
3. **Clear Expectations**: Each test has clearly defined expected output
4. **Realistic Scenarios**: Tests use realistic Lox code patterns
5. **Error Handling**: Tests verify both success and failure cases appropriately

## Known Limitations

- Tests don't cover array/list functionality (not implemented in interpreter)
- Deep recursion scenarios are simplified to avoid stack overflow
- Some complex nested patterns are tested in simplified form

## Future Test Considerations

- Performance tests for closure creation/execution
- Memory leak tests for closure variable capture
- Stress tests with many closures
- Tests for closure interaction with other language features (classes, inheritance)
